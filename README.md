# Overview

For this project I found and used a template from ThemeForest to recreate the Responsive Portfolio we did during Week 2 of this coding bootcamp. I made ReadMe's for the 3 repositories that are linked on my Github profile, and also created projects for those repositories on my LinkedIn account.
